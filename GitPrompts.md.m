riddle me this can we have like four distinct GitHub repos with .jsx (and perhaps .tsx and other types of) files committed there, say, to /Components/, and cross-referenced between the repos, and have the repos have, say an index.html each that uses components from its own and from the other repos? Can we weave a thing like that? If so, please help me, pulling out my GitHub repo names via API, cloning them, dropping Components/<Novelty>.jsx into each, committing and pushing, figuring proper ways to address them from within each other, and running a second and third round of updates and commits.

yes let's do just that give me a well-written, copy-paste able, #comment-annotated shell session transcript creating these precise repos and files (using glh GitHub CLI tool client) and well please proceed.

is that script strictly better or is there anything missing from it?
