These scorecards look much nicer. Let's triple-check that they have all the adequate answers and actionable on them: set a domain name, check out latest commits, inspect at a glance delta between latest bursts of activity and the age, color coded, if there's a live instance, if there are well-ironed-out deployment instructions and scripts in the repo, snippets to use surfaced on the projects card, if any, and so on. links and timestamps should be clickable, live, minimal, inline. Styling cards it very good. Add semantic color accents that would be used when filtering/perspective switching with sidemenu. That's what brings colors out. It switches between presenting where the activity is happening, where the code is stored, where the services are being served, hot ports, endpoints, traffic, load, growth, and so on. These are different perspectives on the scorecards. We just have a global switcher to reemphasize and recompose them. The collection of cards stays the same. We use layers of metadata to represent all we need for varied presentations. All in all it's just a personal project inventory with fancy formatting and lots of care for usability and helpfulness.
