oh come on let's do proper diligent backtesting. Let's settle on a set of indicators beforehand. Let's implement the basic workings of a trading strategy. Let's have a drop sheet at the end of it.

okay make the controls work make it clearer whether motes represent data streams or datapoints, add floating on-hover legends to them, live satiation indicators, and start plotting some forecasts from parametric regressions.

suppose we have a nice performant volatility (and higher-enrichment leading speculative targets) scalping strategy. Let's see a logged and annotated market research, excursion and trading batch orchestration session where it plays out (and prints a drop sheet at the end of run), compare that with a backtesting run report from the same strategy.


okay, what can be *known* about stochastic processes, and how do we go about *matching* formal models with real-world (noisy, uncertain, biased, incomplete) data, and leveraging the mathematical inevitabilities into valid forecasts>?

what questions does that output prompt? Let's try anticipating them and answering them programmatically shall we

is the code adequate to the output and design constraints? If so, explain, if not, redo in a proactive, defensive, consequence-aware manner.

let's make the tree of transforms implied in that code more explicit and more loosely and fluently handled. Let's find tension points nonlinearities and "assumed-over" under examined areas where we might squeeze out more foresight accuracy
