naturally the "DNS" ("Porkbun") section should contain scorecards for my subdomains and UI to designate, create, assign new ones — tie them to the projects by committing CNAME to their GitHub, set up redirects, compose deployment conf and scripts and so on.

The visuals. Bring back the gradients, glows and shadows, diverse color highlights on-hover effects, professionally laid out markup proportions with structured use of negative space, and so on and so forth.
