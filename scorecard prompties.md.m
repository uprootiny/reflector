I do need a repo scorecard template. I do need a project management dashboard. I do need DNS and server switchboard. I do need to get up several projects with several compute nodes and persistence and long-running processes. I don't need all that mess and over sophistication, so let us make a tree and mark nodes done when ther's a commit we could clone from GitHub and run and have it work whatever "it" is. And let's use our tree map to navigate the system and see it growing.
