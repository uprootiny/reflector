🏆 SYSTEM STRENGTHS:
1. Robust contract validation catches errors early
2. Graceful handling of edge cases (constant data, extreme volatility)
3. Efficient performance on large datasets
4. Flexible API supporting diverse use cases
5. Clear error messages aid debugging
6. Modular design enables integration patterns

⚠️  AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
1. Data cleaning could be more automated
2. Performance optimization needed for real-time applications
3. More sophisticated outlier detection algorithms
4. Better handling of partial system failures
5. Enhanced correlation analysis for regime changes
6. More comprehensive signal validation

🔧 PRODUCTION READINESS:
✅ Core functionality stable and tested
✅ Error handling comprehensive
✅ Performance acceptable for most use cases
✅ Integration patterns well-defined
⚠️  Needs monitoring and alerting system
⚠️  Requires operational runbooks for failure scenarios

🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
1. Implement automated data quality monitoring
2. Add real-time streaming capabilities
3. Enhance machine learning integration
4. Build comprehensive test suite
5. Create operational dashboards
6. Develop disaster recovery procedures")
